## A description of the display, including pictures: 
 - Description of the display: Use [Magnetic Ferrofluid](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H40LG4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) to display the due day from google calendar<br>
   1. Acrylic as basic container: Laser cutting acrylic as container for Magnetic Ferrofluid. It has two layers, the first layer have Matrix(14*14) of holes and 3 big holes. The Matrix is for display the duration before due day. 3 big holes act as storage for Magnetic Ferrofluid. When there is a new due, Electromagnet will pull Magnetic Ferrofluid out from big holes into Matrix. Each small hole presents one more day lefting before due.
   2. Copper on the top of Acrylic. There is a layer of copper on the top of the acrylic to prevent acrylic from reaction to the solvent(Isopropanol). 
   3. Wood box to contain sophisticated mechanism and wires.
   4. Sophisticated mechanism: There is an row of electromagnets, which pull the Magnetic Ferrofluid out from the big holes and fill appropriate small holes. An motor is fixed on the top of the inside box to move the row of electromagnets, which control the state of different due.
   5. circuit -- 
   6. summery: When you update one event on your google calendar, this display will probably changed based on its due day. It only contain event which is happened in 14 days, since there are only 14 hole a row. Everytime, this display only show most recent 3 events, according to the number of big holes.
 
## what choices you made for the information to display and the way you displayed it
 - choices made for information to display:<br>
   The most recent 14 days event<br>
   Only 3 events will be showing on the display<br>
 - The way displayed it: For each event, Magnetic Ferrofluid will be pull out to filled one row of small holes. The number of holes be filled present how many days left<br>
